v1.2
• Fixed a bug preventing combined training of multiple networks
• Added Rectified Linear Units as activation function.

v1.1
• Removed redundant function, resulting in considerably faster training
• Renamed erronously named "Cross-Entropy" error function for the Softmax activation function to "Log-Likelihood"
• Fixed an error where colouring nodes by influence wouldn't work for the Softmax activation function
• Changed randomization functions for weights and biases from uniform distribution to normal distribution
• Changed mini-batch default size to 1
• Fixed a small bug in calculating the error while training. This may have increased training speed.

v1.0
• Renamed to "dracon" (dynamic representation and creation of neural networks), since no dynamic generation of networks is possible (yet)
• First useable version

v0.0
• Project started, tentative name "dragon" (dynamic representation and generation of neural networks)
